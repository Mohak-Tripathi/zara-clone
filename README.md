# Challengers we faced and how we resolved them

→ React was fairly new to us and thus it became a challenge to merge the code and solve the conflicts.

→ Another problem was the integration of the front-end and back-end which was a little bit challenging to do but we did that successfully. We tried our best and did the job.

# Learning from the Project

→ In this construct week project, we have used the import-export functionality to export and import the navbar and footer section, it gave the learning to reuse the same code on different pages without complication.

→ Using the ES6 standards in the code base has optimized our program and made it shorter and more interactive.
